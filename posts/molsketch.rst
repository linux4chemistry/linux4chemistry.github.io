molsKetch is a molecular drawing tool for 2D molecular structures. Its goal is to help you draw molecules quick and easily. As well as allowing the user to export high quality images in a number of vector and bitmap formats, it can read and write multiple chemical file formats (using the Open Babel library). molsKetch features intelligent addition/removal of hydrogen atoms and a built-in library that provides quick access to regularly used molecules and functional groups.
