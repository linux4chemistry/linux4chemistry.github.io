MOE (Molecular Operating Environment) can be used to manipulate and analyse large collections of compounds in a spreadsheet-like environment. It can be used to calculate descriptors, for building QSAR/QSPR models, for similarity searching and diverse subset selection, conformational searching and 3D pharmacophore searching. It has an embedded scripting language, SVL (Scientific Vector Language).
