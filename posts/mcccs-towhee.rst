MCCCS Towhee is a Monte Carlo molecular simulation code which can be used for the prediction of fluid phase equilibria using a wide variety of atom-based force fields and several ensembles (Gibbs, Canonical, Isobaric-isothermal and Grand Canonical). It has also been extended for use with solid (or porous) phases.
