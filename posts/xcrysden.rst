XCrySDens (Crystalline Structures and Density) is a crystalline and molecular structure visualisation program, which can superimpose isosurfaces and contours onto crystalline structures and interactively rotate and manipulate them. XCrySDens also provides a (partial) graphical user interface for CRYSTAL, and a visualisation system for PWscf and WIEN2k.
