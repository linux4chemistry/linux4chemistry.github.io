Music (Multi-purpose SImulation Code) is an object-oriented package intended to perform various types of Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations with user-specified forcefields. It can be used to simulate diffusion and adsoprtion in zeolites, for liquid and gas simulations as well, and may be easily extended for solid simulations.
