CORINA (COoRdINAtes), is a rule and data based system, that automatically generates three-dimensional atomic coordinates from the constitution of a molecule as expressed by a connection table or linear code. CORINA offers many features to influence the 3D generation process, e.g. addition of lacking or implicitly given hydrogen atoms, neutralization of formal charges, orientation of the 3D structures according to their moments of inertia, removement of counter ions in salts.
