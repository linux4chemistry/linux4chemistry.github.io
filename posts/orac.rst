ORAC is a molecular dynamics program for running classical simulations of solvated biomolecules. Simulations can be carried out in the NVE, NPT, NHP, and NVT thermodynamic ensembles using multiple time steps integrators. Electrostatic interactions may be handled through the Smooth Particle Mesh Ewald method.
