Moveiemol is a program for visualization and animation of molecular structures. Moviemol typically takes sets of molecular coordinates and displays each of these sets or frames one after the other to create a movie. The molecules/atoms/ions are displayed in ball-and-stick form. At any moment during the animation, the molecules can be rotated or translated, magnified or diminished. The program also produces very nice postscript images of publication quality.
