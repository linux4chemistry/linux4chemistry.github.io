Eden (short for Electron DENsity) implements the 'holographic' method of recovering the electron density in a crystal. The most unconventional feature of the holographic method is that it is a real-space method: it searches for a distribution of electrons in the unit cell that meets all the known constraints on the molecules themselves, while giving rise to the observed diffraction pattern.
