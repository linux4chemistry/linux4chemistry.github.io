GULP performs a variety of types of simulation on 3D periodic solids, gas phase clusters and isolated defects in a bulk material. In particular GULP is designed to handle both molecular solids and ionic materials through the use of the shell model. One difference between GULP and other similar programs is that symmetry is used for solids to accelerate the calculations and to simplify the input.
