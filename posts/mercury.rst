Mercury is a program for visualising crystal structures in three dimensions. Its features include:The ability to load hit lists from ConQuest searches, or to browse the entire Cambridge Structural Database, or to read in crystal structures in various formats. The ability to rotate and translate the 3D crystal-structure display, and to view down cell axes, reciprocal cell axes, and the normals to least-squares and Miller planes. The ability to measure and display distances, angles and torsion angles by atom picking and much more.
