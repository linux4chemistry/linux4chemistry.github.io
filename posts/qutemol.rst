QuteMol is an open source (GPL), interactive, high quality molecular visualization system that aims to improve clarity and provide an easier understanding of the 3D shape and structure of large molecules or complex proteins. Its features include real time ambient occlusion, depth-aware silhouette enhancement, and automatic generation of animated gifs of rotating molecules for web page animations.
