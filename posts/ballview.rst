BallView is a cross-platform molecular visualization tool with support for molecular mechanics optimisation, molecular dynamics and molecular editing. It supports a large number of file formats, SMILES and SMARTS, as well as forcefields such as Amber, MMFF94 and Charmm. Its capabilities also include realtime raytracing and stereoscopic viewing. Actions can be automated using Python scripts.
