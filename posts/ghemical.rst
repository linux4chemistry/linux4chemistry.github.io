Ghemical is a computational chemistry software package with GUIs for both GLUT and GTK+, and some nice 3D-visualization tools. It can do &quot;all atoms&quot; molecular mechanics and dynamics, as well as quantum mechanics (ab initio and semi-empirical) models. It hopefully offers a good framework for a generic freeware molecular modeling tool.
