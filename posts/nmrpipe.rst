The NMRPipe software package consists of a series of standalone programs such as NMRPipe (spectrometer data conversion, advanced multidimensional data processing), NMRDraw (graphical interface for most package tools, interactive processing, script editing interface, time domain data inspection, real-time phasing, automated peak detection, spectral analysis), NMRWish (custom version of Tcl/Tk for spectral analysis, spectral database engine, communication between applications), DC (dipolar coupling and chemical shift analysis) and a multitude of spectral analysis tools.
