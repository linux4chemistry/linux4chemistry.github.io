Who in chemistry never experienced the following: You get your sample back from the analytical department and look shyly at the elemental analysis data - and they are way off. So what usually happens is that one tries to make the numbers fit by postulating solvent inclusion (like 1 mol of EtOH) and then get stressed out with a desktop calculator. That's where this tiny shiny utility comes into play.
