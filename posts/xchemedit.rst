XChemEdit is a package of programs which can draw and edit three-dimensional chemical structures; serve as a graphical interface to the GAUSSIAN, JAGUAR, MOPAC, and BOSS/MCPRO programs; display molecular orbitals, electron densities, and electrostatic potentials; animate normal mode vibrations; and compute solvent-accessible surface area, volume, and thermochemical properties.
