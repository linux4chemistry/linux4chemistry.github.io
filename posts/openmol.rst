OpenMol is a quantum chemical software package: it is an integrated program for electronic structure and property calculations of molecules. User guidance, the evaluation and interpretation of results and computer based learning are the three unique features of OpenMol that distinguish it from all other programs in the field. The concept of OpenMol is based on the fundamental ideas of two software concepts, the (rule based) expert system and the abstract data type model.
