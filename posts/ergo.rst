Ergo is a quantum chemistry program for large-scale self-consistent field calculations. It performs electronic structure calculations using Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham density functional theory using Gaussian basis sets. Linear scaling techniques are employed such as fast multipole methods, hierarchic sparse matrix algebra, density matrix purification, and efficient integral screening.
