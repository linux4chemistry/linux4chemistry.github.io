SCORE is an empirical method for estimating the binding affinity of a protein-ligand complex with known 3D structure. SCORE uses a linear equation to describe the binding energy changes upon the binding process, which includes terms accounting for hydrogen-bonding, hydrophobic effect, and deformation effect.
