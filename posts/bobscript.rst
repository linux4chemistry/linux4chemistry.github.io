BobScript is a program to facilitate the production of publication quality molecular graphics. It is a further development of the program MolScript, but has extensions that make it particularly suited to protein crystallography. Output can be in PostScript format or as a file suitable for rendering with <a href=http://www.bmsc.washington.edu/raster3d/raster3d.html>Raster3D</a>. A conversion program also enables POV-Ray to be used as the rendering engine.
