ChemApp provides the powerful calculation capabilities of ChemSage in the form of a programmer's library. It consists of a rich set of subroutines which provides all the necessary tools for the calculation of complex multicomponent, multiphase chemical equilibria and the determination of the associated energy balances. ChemApp <i>light</i> is the free version of ChemApp, giving you almost the same functionality as the regular version of ChemApp.
