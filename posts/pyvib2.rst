PyVib2 is a program for analyzing vibrational motion and vibrational spectra, written in pure Python. PyVib2 permits the automatic correlation of vibrational motions of molecules thereby allowing an understanding of Raman, Raman optical activity (ROA), infrared vibrational absorption (IR), and vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra. Features include a Versatile representation of vibrational motions, visualization of Raman/ROA and IR/VCD generation in molecules and the production of publication quality spectra. It currently supports DALTON and Gaussian output files.
