Debyer takes a file with atom positions as input, and outputs X-ray and neutron diffraction patterns, the total scattering structure function, the pair distribution function (PDF), and related functions such as the RDF (reduced PDF). It can be used for comparison of molecular dynamics simulations or other models of atomistic structure of the material with X-ray and neutron powder diffraction experiments.
