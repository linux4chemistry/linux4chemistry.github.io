Olex2 is an easy-to-use program for small-molecule structure solution and refinement. It also includes many useful tools for structure analysis, archiving and report generation. All aspects of the structure determination and publication process are presented in a single, workflow-driven package - with the ultimate goal of producing an application which will be useful to both chemists and crystallographers.
