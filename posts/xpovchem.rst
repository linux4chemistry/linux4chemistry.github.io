XPovChem is a molecule viewer based on the PovRay raytracer. It takes a molecule description, converts it into a .pov file, and lets povray render the image -- thus allowing a very high rendering quality. Xpovchem includes the professional Babel molecule format converter and is a GUI frontend to Paul Thiessen's povchem console program.
