CRYSTAL computes the electronic structure of periodic systems within Hartree Fock, density functional or various hybrid approximations. The Bloch functions of the periodic systems are expanded as linear combinations of atom centred Gaussian functions. CRYSTAL may be used to perform studies of the physical, electronic and magnetic structure of molecules, polymers, surfaces and crystalline solids.
