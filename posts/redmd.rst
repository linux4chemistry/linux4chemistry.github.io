RedMD (Reduced Molecular Dynamics) is an open source package for molecular dynamics simulations and normal mode analysis for coarse-grained models of proteins and nucleic acids. Force fields are based on one-bead elastic network models and their extensions. The code is written in C/C++ and is parallelized.
