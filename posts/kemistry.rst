Kemistry is a collection of chemistry-related applications written for the KDE2. The Kemistry package provides three applications: KMolCalc - a molecular weight calculator; KDrawStruct - a 2D structures editor; KMolViewer - a 3D molecular renderer. All Kemistry applications are still in their early development stages.
