BIGMAC stands for Beyond Impressive Goals of Mechanical Artificial Computations. It uses Configurational Bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) to compute thermodynamic properties of flexible molecules. It has been used to study the adsorption behavior of linear and branched alkanes in zeolites and the vapour-liquid equilibrium of linear and branched alkanes.
