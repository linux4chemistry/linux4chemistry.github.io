WODCA (World of Computer Assisted Synthesis Planning or Workbench for the Organization of Data for Chemical Applications) is a computer program for the interactive planning of organic syntheses, in particular, for the planning of organic syntheses in a retrosynthetic approach. Built-in catalogs of fine chemicals like those from Acros Organics or Fluka Chemical Company provide suitable starting materials for a synthesis target.
