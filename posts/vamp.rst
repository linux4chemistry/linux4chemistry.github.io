Semiempirical program package containingthe MINDO3, MNDO, MNDOC, AM1 and PM3 Hamiltonian. It is capable of performing geometry optimisations as well as transition state searches and provides some extended multi center charge models (NAO-PC, HO-PC, LMO-PC); additionally, it may be used for some QM/MM calculations.
