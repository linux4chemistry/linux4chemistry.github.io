The SIRware suite includes SIR97 (Direct Method program for the resolution and refinement of crystal structures using single crystal data), SIR2002 (Direct Method program for the resolution of proteins using single crystal data; can be used also for resolution and refinement of small and medium size crystal structures) and SIR2004 (automatic solution of crystal structures by Direct and Patterson Methods; it can be used both for resolution and refinement of small/medium size crystal structures and for macromolecules with data up to 1.4-1.5 Ang.)
