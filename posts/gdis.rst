GDIS (GTK Display Interface for Structures) is a visualization program for small molecules, crystals, and solution cells. It has support for common crystallographic file formats, and assorted tools for visualization (including diffraction pattern generation), manipulation, and model creation. Rendering of molecules and energy minimization are also possible via Povray and GULP.
