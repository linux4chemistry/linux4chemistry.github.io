Molpro is a system of ab initio programs for molecular electronic structure calculations. with an emphasis on highly accurate computations, with extensive treatment of the electron correlation problem through the multiconfiguration-reference CI, coupled cluster and associated methods. Using recently developed integral-direct local electron correlation methods, accurate ab initio calculations can be performed for much larger molecules than with most other programs.
