DL_MESO is a general purpose mesoscopic simulation package developed at Daresbury Laboratory as part of a collaborative computational project for the Computer Simulation of Condensed Phases (CCP5). DL_MESO can simulate condensed phases using the Lattice-Boltzmann Equation, Dissipative Particle Dynamics and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics.
