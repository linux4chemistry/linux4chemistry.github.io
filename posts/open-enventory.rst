open enventory is an integrated laboratory journal and inventory program. It is a web application that runs in your browser. Automatic acquisition of freely accessible data from online databases makes manual data acquisition and catalogue searches obsolete, and price surveys can be done with a mouseclick. The laboratory journal uses the information available in the inventory database and makes the data available for all members of a workgroup. Both inventory and laboratory journal have the ability to allow data exchange between workgroups.
