The Gnu Xtal System is a package of over sixty crystallographic programs for calculations ranging from the reduction of raw diffraction intensities, to the solution, refinement and publication of crystal structures. These are applicable to X-ray, neutron and electron diffraction analyses, including charge density studies. The package contains interactive graphics tools.
