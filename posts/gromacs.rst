GROMACS is a versatile package for performing molecular dynamics. Some features of the software: standard MD simulations, energy minimizations, NMR refinement using NOE data, high performance due to well optimized code and smart algorithms, automatic topology generation from a building block library, flexible force field usage, non-equilibrium MD, many analysis and preprocessing tools.
