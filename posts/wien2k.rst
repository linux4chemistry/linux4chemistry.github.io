.. comments: Only for solids...is this chemistry?

WIEN2k allows the user to perform electronic structure calculations of solids using density functional theory (DFT). It is based on the full-potential (linearized) augmented plane-wave ((L)APW) + local orbitals (lo) method, one of the most accurate schemes for band structure calculations.
