ALMOND is a program specifically developed for generating and handling alignment independent descriptors called GRIND (GRid INdependent Descriptors). These are a new generation of 3D-molecular descriptors with application in 3D-QSAR, QSAR, virtual screening, design of combinatorial libraries, selectivity studies and in any field where 3D quantitative pharmacophoric description for (macro)molecules is needed.
