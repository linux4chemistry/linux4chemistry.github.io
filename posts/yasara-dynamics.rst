YASARA Dynamics contains YASARA View and adds support for molecular simulations. Beside the YASARA NOVA Force Field and the new highly accurate YAMBER force fields, you can use other well known MD force fields like AMBER, and run accurate all-atom MD simulations in aqueous solution with Particle Mesh Ewald longrange electrostatics at twice the speed you know from other programs. YASARA Dynamics is not a black box with input and output files, but shows the MD simulation in real-time on screen. You can fully interact with the scene, pull atoms or whole molecules around.
