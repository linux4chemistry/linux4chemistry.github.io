JMap3d takes volumetric data (particularly electron density data) and polygonises them, in order to produce up to five iso-surfaces. The result is written to a VRML97 (VRML2.0) file, which can then be viewed with any VRML viewer of your choice or with the included Java3D VRML viewer (from the Java3D &amp; VRML working group).
