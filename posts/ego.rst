EGO is a parallel program for molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules. The program computes molecular dynamics trajectories. It uses a multiple time step algorithm combined with a structure adapted fast multipole method for the description of long range electrostatics. The method has been demonstrated to scale linearly with the number of atoms in the range of about 40,000 atoms.
