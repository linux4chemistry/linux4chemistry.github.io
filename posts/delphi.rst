DelPhi provides numerical solutions to the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (both linear and nonlinear form) for molecules of arbitrary shape and charge distribution. It is fast, accurate, and can handle extremely high lattice dimensions. It also includes flexible features for assigning different dielectric constants to different regions of space and for treating systems containing mixed salt solutions.
