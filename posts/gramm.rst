GRAMM (Global Range Molecular Matching) is a program for protein-protein and protein-ligand docking. To predict the structure of a complex, it requires only the atomic coordinates of the two molecules. The program performs an exhaustive 6-dimensional search through the relative translations and rotations of the molecules.
