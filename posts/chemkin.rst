CHEMKIN is a set of software tools for solving complex chemical kinetics problems. It allows users to predict the chemical conditions of their system based on variable reactor parameters, inlet gas, and catalyst compositions when applicable. CHEMKIN consists of gas and surface-phase chemical kinetic solvers, and a variety of reactor models that can be used to represent the different systems you are interested in modeling.
