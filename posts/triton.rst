Triton is a graphical tool for modelling protein mutants (using the external program MODELLER) and assessment of their activities (using the external program MOPAC). Semi-quantitative predictions of mutants' activities can be achieved by evaluating the changes in energies of the system and partial atomic charges of the active site residues during the reaction.
