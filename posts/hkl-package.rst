The HKL Package is a suite of programs for the analysis of X-ray diffraction data collected from single crystals. It consists of three parts: XdisplayF for visualization of the diffraction pattern, Denzo for data reduction and integration, and Scalepack for merging and scaling of the intensities obtained by Denzo or other programs.
