SIMPSON is a General Simulation Program for Solid-State NMR. It features multi-pulse 1D/2D experiments on large spin-systems with input-files implemented using a simple scripting language. The program is designed to emulate a NMR spectrometer by letting the user specify high-level NMR concepts such as spin systems, nuclear spin interactions, rf irradiation, free precession, phase cycling, coherence-order filtering, and implicit/explicit acquisition.
