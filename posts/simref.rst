simref is a structure refinement program for the simultaneous evaluation of several powder diffraction data sets and multiple phases per data set. With a structural model all calculated diffraction profiles are fitted to the corresponding observed diffraction profile by the method of least squares. This procedure is called Rietveld method (Rietveld, 1969 ). By the simultaneous refinement of several data sets new evaluation techniques are possible.
