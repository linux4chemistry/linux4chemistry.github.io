ProtoFit is a tool for optimization of surface protonation models from acid-base titration data. Although ProtoFit is designed with the analysis of the proton buffering behavior of surfaces in mind, it can be used equally well for other substances such as a dissolved acids that reversibly exchanges protons with water.
