Dirac (Direct Iterative Relativistic All-electron Calculations) uses FORTRAN (and a bit of C) code for relativistic molecular calculations based on the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian. It solves the the 4-component DHF equations by the SCF iterative procedure and provides tools for analysis of the converged wave function.
