MCPRO performs Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations of peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids in solution; it was derived from BOSS, but makes extensive use of the concept of residues. Free energy changes can be computed via FEP calculations and have been used extensively for studying protein-ligand binding.
