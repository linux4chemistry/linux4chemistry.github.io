Sparkle/AM1 is a computational chemistry model which exploits the lanthanide series characteristics to accurately predict geometries of the coordination polyhedra of complexes of ions of the rare earth metals. It is distributed as an external file for MOPAC 93r2, and as the default model for a modified version of the public domain MOPAC 6.
