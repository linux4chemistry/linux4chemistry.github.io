The Dalton Quantum Chemistry Program represents a powerful quantum chemistry program for the calculation of molecular properties with SCF, MP2 or MCSCF wave functions. The strengths of the program are mainly in the areas of magnetic and (frequency-dependent) electric properties, and for studies of molecular potential energy surfaces, both for static and dynamical investigations.
