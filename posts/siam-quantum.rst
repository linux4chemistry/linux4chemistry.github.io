Siam Quantum is an ab initio quantum chemistry program that uses quantum mechanics to determine the total energy and wave function of molecules within the framework of the Hartee-Fock method. The source code and documentation was originally designed to introduce students to electronic structure calculations. It can perform geometry optimisation and simple population analysis. Further developments are ongoing.
