Dockres reads the log file of docking runs performed by Autodock and extracts the top scoring poses subject to various filters. The program also calculates distributions of various properties of the ligand set (e.g. molecular weight, number of hydrogen bond donors) and the distribution of docking sites as well as the distribution of docking free energies per target residue.
