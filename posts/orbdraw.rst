Orbdraw is a visualization program for displaying molecular orbital and electron density data from Gaussian, Gamess, Jaguar, Hondo, Mopac or Ampac calculations. Orbdraw can display the molecular orbitals, electron densities or spin densities in 3D as either wire frames or solid surfaces and can map orbitals or charges onto the density surfaces.
