AutoDock is a suite of automated docking tools. It is designed to predict how small molecules, such as substrates or drug candidates, bind to a receptor of known 3D structure. Search methods include evolutionary methods such as the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm, in addition to the Monte Carlo simulated annealing (SA) method.
