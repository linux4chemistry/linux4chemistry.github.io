CCP1GUI is a free, extensible Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed for GAMESS-UK, but also supporting other packages. The GUI has been built around the Python open-source programming language and the VTK visualisation toolkit. It has support for conventional formats such as Z-matrix and PDB, as well as programme-specific formats for CHARMM, ChemShell, XMol and Gaussian.
