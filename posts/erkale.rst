ERKALE is a quantum chemistry program used to solve the electronic structure of atoms, molecules and molecular clusters. The main use of ERKALE is the computation of x-ray properties, such as ground-state electron momentum densities and Compton profiles, and core (x-ray absorption and x-ray Raman scattering) and valence electron excitation spectra of atoms and molecules.
