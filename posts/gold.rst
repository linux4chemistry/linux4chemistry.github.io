GOLD is a program for calculating the docking modes of small molecules into protein binding sites as part of a virtual screening application. Docking is performed using a genetic algorithm and incorporates full ligand flexibility and partial protein flexibility. The GoldScore and ChemScore scoring functions are available, or a custom scoring function can be implemented. Cavity-bound waters and constraints can be included as part of the docking procedure.
