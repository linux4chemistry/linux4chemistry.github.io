ADF is the Amsterdam Density Functional program system for high-quality computational chemistry research. The two main programs are ADF, for molecules, and BAND for periodic structures: polymers, slabs, and crystals. Several smaller utility and property programs are available for pre- and post-processing data of the main calculations.
