SimSoup is is a graphical artificial chemistry simulator. The program enables a chemistry to be defined in terms of molecule types and the possible interactions between them. A simulation run involves setting up a number of molecules of various molecule types in a reactor, and then allowing interactions to take place over a period of time.
