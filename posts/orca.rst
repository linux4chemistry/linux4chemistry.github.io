The program ORCA is a modern electronic structure program package with specific emphasis on spectroscopic properties of open-shell molecules. It features a wide variety of standard quantum chemical methods ranging from semiempirical methods to DFT to correlated ab initio methods. It can also treat environmental and relativistic effects.
