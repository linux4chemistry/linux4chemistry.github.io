Cantera is a suite of object-oriented software tools for problems involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and/or transport processes. You can use Cantera from Python or Matlab to handle problems in areas such as combustion, flame structure, detonations, electrochemical energy conversion, fuel cells, aqueous electrolytes, plasmas and thin-film deposition.
