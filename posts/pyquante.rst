PyQuante is an open source suite of programs for developing quantum chemistry methods, written in the Python programming language, but with many rate-determining modules written in C for speed. The resulting code is easy to understand and modify, providing a well-engineered set of tools so that scientists can construct their own quantum chemistry programs without going through the tedium of having to write every low-level routine.
