MMC is a Metropolis Monte Carlo program for the simulation of molecular assemblies in the canonical, grand-canonical and isothermal-isobaric ensembles employing several convergence acceleration techniques (e.g., force-biased displacement, extension-biased and local torsion changes, preferential selection of solvent to be moved, cavity-biased insertion, virial-biased volume change).
