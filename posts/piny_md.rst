PINY_MD is capable of performing a wide variety of molecular dynamics, electronic structure, and geometry optimization calculations. Such capabilities include force-field based simulations on system ranging in complexity from simple molecular liquids and crystals to large biomolecular systems. In addition, PINY_MD can perform  ab initio  molecular dynamics and geometry optimization using plane-wave based generalized gradient (GGA) density functional based representations of the electronic structure combined with the Car-Parrinello propagation scheme.
