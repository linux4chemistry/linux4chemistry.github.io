Spock is a molecular visualisation program which can display and manipulate atoms, bonds, hydrogen bonds, solid and surfaces, CA traces, electrostatic potential contours, backbone worms, and even electron density maps. Spock can also be used for real-time conferencing over the internet. Spock is free for use in academic courses and for academics without sufficient funding.
