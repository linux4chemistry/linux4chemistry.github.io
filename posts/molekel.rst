MOLEKEL is an interactive, three-dimensional molecular graphics package. MOLEKEL represents molecules,it can superimpose molecules, calculates and displays isosurfaces of electron and spin densities as well as molecular orbitals from the output of various electronic structure calculation programs. MOLEKEL can animate and display vibrational modes, animate geometry optimizations and multiple coordinate PDB and XYZ files.
