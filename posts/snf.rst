SNF has been developed for the calculation of Infrared, Raman, and VROA spectra using the harmonic approximation for the frequencies and the double harmonic approximation for the intensities. Vibrational frequencies are determined using numerical differentiation of analytical gradients of the total electronic energy, while infrared, Raman, and VROA intensities are obtained by numerical differentiation of dipole moments and (generalized) polarizability tensor components with respect to nuclear coordinates. Single point calculations are carried out using ADF, Dalton, Gaussian, Molpro or Turbomole.
