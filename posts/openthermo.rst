OpenThermo is a program package for statistical thermodynamics computations beyond rigid rotor harmonic oscillator approximation (RRHOA), with taking into account internal rotations and vibration anharmonicity. In contrast to statistical subprograms integrated to QC packages, OpenThermo is designed to make the calculation transparent to user and give maximum control under the choice of used theories and approximations.
